# Machine Learning Project: Clustering and Classification of Transactional Data

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze transactional data for effective segmentation and predictive modeling. It focuses on clustering using unsupervised learning algorithms and classification using supervised learning models. The goal is to derive actionable insights, optimize business processes, and support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Objectives

### Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering
1. Segment the dataset using K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.
2. Determine the optimal number of clusters using evaluation metrics such as the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and Davies-Bouldin Index.
3. Identify distinguishing features for each cluster and provide meaningful interpretations.
4. Recommend suggestive names and potential use cases for each cluster to aid in strategic planning.

### Supervised Machine Learning: Classification & Regression
1. Classify the data into predefined clusters, segments, or classes based on clustering results.
2. Identify significant features and their thresholds influencing classification.
3. Evaluate classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) based on performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC).
4. Recommend the best-performing model for real-world deployment.

## Data Description
- **Source:** Google Drive
- **Size:** 1.8 MB
- **Type:** Cross-sectional
- **Variables:**
  - Numeric: `Quantity`, `Value`, `Weight`, etc.
  - Categorical: `Country`, `Product`, `Shipping_Method`, etc.
- **Key Metrics:**
  - 16 variables and 15,000 observations.

## Key Findings

### Data Preprocessing
- Categorical variables encoded using one-hot and label encoding.
- Numeric variables scaled using Min-Max normalization.
- Outliers addressed using robust scaling techniques.

### Clustering Insights
- K-Means identified five distinct clusters:
  - **Cluster 1:** High-value air shipments.
  - **Cluster 2:** Bulk sea freight.
  - **Cluster 3:** Heavy rail cargo.
  - **Cluster 4:** Luxury products.
  - **Cluster 5:** Standard goods.
- DBSCAN struggled with noise and parameter sensitivity.

### Classification Insights
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression and Decision Tree in terms of accuracy and feature importance analysis.
- Key predictive variables include `Value`, `Weight`, and `Shipping_Method`.

## Recommendations
1. Use K-Means for segmentation due to its consistent and interpretable results.
2. Employ Random Forest for classification tasks to ensure robust and accurate predictions.
3. Scale numeric data and encode categorical variables before model training.
4. Use 80:20 train-test split with stratified sampling for classification tasks.
